🚗 Car Rental Management System using Java 🚗
The Car Rental Management System 🚘 is a Java-based console application designed to efficiently manage the process of renting and returning cars. This system helps automate the traditional manual car rental process by providing a simple, interactive, and reliable solution using core Java concepts ☕.

In this application, each car is represented as an object 🧩 with attributes such as Car ID, Car Model, Rental Price per Day, and Rental Status (Available / Rented). The system allows users to view available cars 👀, rent a car for a specified number of days 📆, return a rented car 🔁, and calculate the total rental cost 💰 automatically.

The project follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles 🏗️ such as encapsulation, modularity, and abstraction, making the code clean, reusable, and easy to maintain. To ensure reliability and smooth execution, essential exception handling ⚠️ is implemented to handle scenarios like invalid input ❌, renting an already rented car 🚫, returning a car that is not rented 🔄, entering invalid rental days ⛔, and selecting a non-existing car 🔍.

This mini project is ideal for students to understand real-world application development using Java and strengthens concepts like classes and objects, collections, custom exceptions, loops, and menu-driven programs 📚. The system can be further extended by adding features such as customer login, file/database storage, and GUI support 🎨.
